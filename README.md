# Nightcorify
Make crappy nightcore out of your most hated songs to annoy your friends and disappoint your family!

## Development
If you want to host your own version of Nightcorify, you can start a local server by running `dart bin/server.dart` inside the repo directory. Or if you're using Visual Studio Code, you can just run the default configuration.

You need to have [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed!
